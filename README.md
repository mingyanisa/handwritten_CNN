# Final Project: Handwritten CNN
## Computational Neuroscience Course 2019
Yanisa Sunthornyotin

The main files is 
<li> src/final_proj.ipynb for .ipynb code
<li> NeuroSci Final Project (option B).pdf for the documentation 

or alternatively  
<li> src/CNN.m for matlab version however the evaluation result maybe be different. In the source code, there are many neural network architecture that can be chosen based on your preferences. However, the dataset location might need to be changed based on your file directory.
<li> Matlab_result.pdf will show you the evaluation result for CNN in Matlab code and the comparison to additional SVM model.

All the handwritten image dataset is stored in src/data folder
